# Learning Log

Make your own Learning Log, and keep a list of the
topics you're learning about. Whenever you learn something new
about a topic, make an entry summarizing what you've learned.

The database is not included:
For creating an databasefile, run the following code in an active virtual environment.
```python
python mnage.py migrate
```
